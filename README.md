## My programming experience
I started to learn programming at the beginning of 2019. Before that I was mainly working as a video editor.

To learn iOS development, I have combined one year with **OpenClassrooms online course** and one year at the ** Apple Developer Academy of Naples.**
I graduated in february 2020 in app development with Openclassroms, and for the Apple Developer Academy, I will graduate at the end of june 2020 👩🏻‍🎓.

During this lockdown, I created my first app on the App Store: **CookMe**. [Here is the link!](https://apps.apple.com/sz/app/cookme/id1508888799)

Swift was my first programming language and I love it, I love coding! 👩🏻‍💻

## What's next?
My next step is to learn Android development with the **Raywenderlich Android bootcamp** of 3 months!
And I hope to get a job as an iOS/Android Developer in September 2020!
